# Chromosome conformation capture Hi-C

Right, so now you have learned about Chromosome conformation capture and scaffolding genomes with the Hi-C technology. Today you are going to evaluate results generated 
by two scaffolding tools: (i) [SALSA2](https://github.com/marbl/SALSA) and (ii) [YaHS](https://github.com/c-zhou/yahs). 

Because we don't have time to run the whole command during the course (it can take days), I have generated both results for you for our species *Apodemus sylvaticus*.
