# Linux

We just learned a bunch of Linux command together. Now I'll give you time to play with some of these commands by yourself.

I have a file in our server that you will need for this next exercise. It's baseb here:

```console
path/

# if you list that folder, you will see the file there

ls -lth path/proteins.fasta
```

For your free time playing with Linux, I want you to:

1-) Create a folder called ```protein_manipulation```
2-) Inside this folder, create another folder called ```test_symlink```
3-) Copy the file ```proteins.fasta``` to the folder ```protein_manipulation```
4-) Symlink the file ```proteins.fasta``` to the folder ```test_symlink```
5-) Tell me: is ```proteins.fasta``` made of fasta or fastq sequences?
6-) Count how many sequences there are in the file
7-)
