# Linux

We just learned a bunch of Linux commands together. Now I'll give you time to play with some of these commands by yourself.

I have a file in our server that you will need for this next exercise. This is the whole path to the file:

```console
/home/marcela/linux/protein.fasta
```

For your free time playing with Linux, I want you to:

1-) From your home directory, create a folder called ```protein_manipulation```

2-) Inside this folder, create another folder called ```test_symlink```

3-) Copy the file ```proteins.fasta``` to the folder ```protein_manipulation```

4-) Symlink the file ```proteins.fasta``` to the folder ```test_symlink```

5-) Tell me: is ```proteins.fasta``` made of fasta or fastq sequences?

6-) Count how many sequences there are in the file.

7-) Create a notes.txt file with nano

8-) Write a few sentences inside this file about what you learned today. Save the file.
